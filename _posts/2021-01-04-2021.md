Thank [Tiny Tom](http://tinytomdonuts.com/) 2021 is here.

I'm not one for the new year resolutions. But, with the shut-in of last year
I realized I need some new hobies that doesn't involve hanging out with a bunch
of people.

Here're my top list:

- Golf: this is the year I learn to swing. Youtube is my friend.

- Folding Origami: goal 1 or 2 per month, commited to memory.

- Meditation: Ramp up to daily ritual by EOY. Headspace? Calm? Curate my own?

This year is also about health,

- Lose the pandemic 15. Need to cut about 15 lbs, or cut fat %.

- Cardio: I used to run everyday. Can I setup a tred at home without
  much space and on a budget?  What about guided workouts? Research required.

- Food: Less processed food. No high carb (burgers, pizza, ice-cream, sweets).
  More greens.

- Health Tracking: can I track my blood sugar level? spikes and daily
  intake on a granualar level? I don't care about invasiveness and I'm not
  squirmish.

Something together with the partner:

- Stand-up comidy. Learn how to be funny infront of people.

- Plants. Set up more plants at the home.

Got a comment, a suggestion? Send me a tweet at @pxue, Iâ€™d love to hear your thought!
