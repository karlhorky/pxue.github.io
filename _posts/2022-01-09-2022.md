I can't believe 2022 is already here.

I made a resolution list last year, let's review it first:

Top of the list: 1/3:

- Golf: I did pick up golf last year, I've learnt to swing.

Health:

- I failed to make any major changes to my health habits.

2021 was another very physically inert year. I feel due to not moving
physically, it is starting to slowing my mind down.

2022.

- Continued from 2021: Make concrete plans to move. 1hr of move minutes a day.
The older I get the more I understand health is the most important asset you can
have.

- Travel again.
Lockdown is deadly on the mental health, we are social creatures and aren't
meant to be locked in a box in the sky.
