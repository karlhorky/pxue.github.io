### What I accomplished/am thankful for in the first half of 2022.

- I have transitioned to focus 100% of my time on [Cloutdesk](https://www.cloutdesk.com).
  We help creators manage their businesses 10x better, so they can focus on the
  creative parts and not the boring parts.

  - We've grown our revenue by +290% in the past 6 month, comparing to the
    previous period (6 month, June 1st-December 1st, 2021).

  - We've fully launched CDFM (Cloutdesk for Marketers). An app that gives marketers
    the ability to track, recruit, negotiate, sign, manage, and pay creator all
    in one place.

  - Continued to improve Cloutdesk.com for Creators, adding highly anticipated features like
    Content Approval.

  - Lots of other amazing and technically challenging improvements to the
    platform!

- Spent an amazing two month in the winter in Mexico (Playa del Carmen), already
  planning to head back this coming winter. Can't wait to see our new friends there.

- Weight loss is a success! Reduced from 165lb down to 150lb! Target is
  a consistent 145lb, eating less + moving more is the key.

- Continued to improve my Golf swing :)

- Found an amazing (our new fav.) [Korean restaurant](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/jin-dal-lae-toronto) in town.

- Fully embraced plant based diet a la this [amazing spot](https://www.saigonlotustoronto.ca/).

- Celebrated my 32nd trip around the Sun with friends and loved ones in NYC.

- Celebrated the beginning of summer with amazing co-workers on a boat and
  in-person after almost 2 years of virtual first work.

and many more.

### The future:

- Communication is hard.

- Asking for help is hard.

I want to understand and measure this:

```
Luck = [Doing Things] * [Telling People]
```

How to increase one's luck?

1. By doing lots of things
2. By telling lots of people

I think I'm good at 1 but not 2. I need to learn how to improve 2 and ask for
help more often.
