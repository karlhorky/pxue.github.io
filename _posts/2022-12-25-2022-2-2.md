### It's end of the year, time for another recap

- I'm really proud of what [Cloutdesk](https://www.cloutdesk.com) has achieved
  in 2022.

  - We've grown our revenue by +600% in the past 12 month.
  - CDFM is now our leading monetization platform, onboarding more paying
    opportunities.
  - 600+ pieces of content were uploaded and approved on Cloutdesk, enabling
    creators and markets to efficiently manage this complicated process.

- I'm continously improving my communication ability and thoughtfully ask hard
  questions.

- Heading back to Mexico for winter of 2023. Cannot wait.

- We adopted the cutest little pug! Meet

### The future

- Profitability.

- Keep asking the hard questions and ask smart people for help.

- Tell more people of what I have accomplished, learn how to celebrate wins and
  communicate missions.
