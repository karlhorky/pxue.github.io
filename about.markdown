### Hi there 👋

I'm Paul, I've been a professional developer for 10+ years. Mostly Go, some React.

📍 I'm located in Toronto, Canada

🔭 I've cofounded two startups. [Localyyz](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/localyyz-1-trending-app-shopify-store-stefan-suppa/) and [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/).

💡 I'm also the founder of [Spacestation Labs](https://spacestation.github.io), a software consultancy, we help bring tech expertise to startups.

💼 I'm currently leading technology at [CloutJam](https://www.cloutjam.com/), a tool for social influencers to track and organize their operations.

I like to think about new problems, solve old ones better, and always down to hop on a zoom call (or coffee post covid).
If you need a tech person to bounce your ideas off, don't hesitate to reach out.

📫 You can reach me via my personal email or catch me on the [Gopher Slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/).
