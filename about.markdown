### Hi there 👋

I'm Paul, I've been a professional developer for 10+ years, mostly Go since and some React.

📍 I'm located in Toronto, Canada

🔭 I've cofounded two startups. I'm currently working on [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/), a men's personal styling service over sms.

💡 I'm also the founder of [Spacestation Labs](https://github.com/spacestation/spacestation) a software consultancy.

I like to think about new problems, solve old ones better, and always down to hop on a zoom call (or coffee post covid).
If you need a tech entrepreneaur to bounce your great idea off of, don't hesitate to reach out.

📫 You can reach me via my personal email (it's in my bio) or on the [Gopher Slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/).
